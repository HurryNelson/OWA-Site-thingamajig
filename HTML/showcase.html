      <p>The previous project was creating this website to showcase the things we did throughout the year through videos and pictures. We are continuing work on the project to make it meet the new requirements. It has separate pages for a random quote
      generator using JavaScript, a page for our resumes, and a page for showcasing previous projects</p>
